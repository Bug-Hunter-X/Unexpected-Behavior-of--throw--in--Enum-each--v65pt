This repository demonstrates an interesting edge case concerning exception handling in Elixir's `Enum.each`.  The provided code shows `throw` being called within an `Enum.each`, and despite the `throw`, the loop continues to the end. This is different from how exceptions are expected to behave.  The solution offers a more appropriate way to handle such exceptional cases within list processing, providing improved robustness and clearer error handling.
